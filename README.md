# Password Generator

## Description
The purpose of this application is to allow a user to add and save items to a daily planner with the visual aid of the hours of the day being color coordinated to reflect hours that have passed (white), the current hour (red) and the future hours (green). The application is designed to store saved items into local storage so that the user will be able to see their saved events even when the page is closed and then re-opened.
